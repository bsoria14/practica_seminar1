## R Markdown

This is an R Markdown document. Markdown is a simple formatting syntax for authoring HTML, PDF, and MS Word documents. For more details on using R Markdown see <http://rmarkdown.rstudio.com>.

When you click the **Knit** button a document will be generated that includes both content as well as the output of any embedded R code chunks within the document. You can embed an R code chunk like this:

```{r}
#Load libraries
library(tidyverse)
library(dplyr)

#Load dataset mtcars 

data(mtcars)

#Create function to transform data
transformed_data <- function(data) {
  data_2 <- data %>%
    mutate(new_column= rownames(data)) %>% #Add a new column with the names of the rows
    select(new_column,1:2) #Select only the new column and the 2 first columns of the dataset
  return(data_2)
}

# Calling the function and assigning the result to a new daatset
transformed_mtcars <- transformed_data(mtcars)

# Printing the results
print(transformed_mtcars)

```

## Second Transformation

You can also embed plots, for example:

```{r pressure, echo=FALSE}
#Creating the function to group the information by the first column
grouped_data <- function(data_new) {
  data_3 <- data %>%
    group_by(across(1)) %>% #Grouping by the first column
    summarise(count=n()) #Present the number of unit that match wit the category of the first column
  return(data_3)
}
# Calling the function and assigning the result to a new daatset
grouped_mtcars <- grouped_data(transformed_mtcars) 
#Printing the results
print(grouped_mtcars)
```

Note that the `echo = FALSE` parameter was added to the code chunk to prevent printing of the R code that generated the plot.
